Not counting Orientation and Graduation, the course is comprised of 6 Modules.

![You are here arrow pointing to orientation, with the other six modules and graduation in a timeline to the right](/images/you-are-here.jpg)

You'll get a reminder email every week with a links and info about the next Module (you should already have an email with a link to Module 1). 

You can progress through the course faster than that if you'd like, but you'll likely find that there is more than enough material in each Module to keep your mind engaged for a week. And there's no rush: **you're invited to take as long as you'd like.**
