Each Module has a distinct theme, replete with its own guiding questions (which you'll find on the [home screen of that module](/)).

The guiding questions for Orientation, for example, were:

>Whatâ€™s this course all about? Where is everything located? How are we going to be humble with our learning and generous with our teaching?

While you're completing any given module, keep the guiding questions in mind. All of the topics and materials are meant to serve those questions, and help you find answers.
