Orientation has a bunch of Topics that you will progress through as you click the "Next" buttons at the bottom of each page.

If youâ€™re on a big screen, youâ€™ll see them on the left under the â€œOrientation" header (if you're on a mobile device, click the three bars icon).

As you can see, Orientation includes:

- Welcome (where you are right now)
- Meet Your Facilitators (where we'll be going soon)
- Navigating the Course
- Apply Topically
- Navigating the Community
- Finding Resources

**You can likely buzz through Orientation in about 45 minutes, give or take**. You're welcome to take longer, of course. This isn't a race.

And know that this will all be here for you to refer back to throughout the course (you will not be tested on this ðŸ˜¬).
