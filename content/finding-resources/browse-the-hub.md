If the thing you're looking for isn't in your email, it's probably the Hub, somewhere. **Use the search to find it quickly**.

Most of the resources linked throughout the course exist in some form on the Hub.

Click the magnifying glass, type a keyword or two and results will start to show up. Hopefully whatever you need is there.
