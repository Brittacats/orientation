If checking your email and visiting the help page don't do it, lean on us. **The team supporting this course _is_ your resource.**

You can email team@sjmd.space with your question, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. (Or email Sam directly if you have a private message by sending your note to sK@hues.xyz)

If you're not sure if we can help with something or not, just ask. **No question is off limits**, and we'll happily reply and let you know if something is beyond our capacity (and, when possible, point you in a more helpful direction).
