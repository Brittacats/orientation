An easy way to ask us questions, and also get support from other people who are SJMD-inclined, is by joining the [SJMD Community](https://community.sjmd.space).

The Community is powered by [Discourse](https://discourse.org), which is a fun, interactive forum platform. We even have a walled-off [section within the community dedicated to the course](https://community.sjmd.space/c/course).

While membership in the Community isn't necessary to get the most out of the Course, you might find it to be a useful resource as you complete the Modules, fieldwork, and course materials.
