Topics explore an idea related to the module, and will be comprised of steps that include the following:

- {{< icon read >}} **Readings** (a chapter from a book, an article, a blog post, an essay, etc.)
- {{< icon watch >}} **Watchings** (a YouTube video, TED talk, documentary clip, etc.)
- {{< icon listen >}} **Listenings** (a podcast episode, interview clip, etc.)


Everything is optional, _and_ everything is recommended. It's up to you to pick and choose what you take in.

We know it won’t be possible for everyone to read/listen/watch/do everything, so we’re not expecting you to. The course is designed to still be meaningful without 100% completion.
