Within each of the main course modules there are 7 topics (not Orientation, which you’re clicking through now, or Graduation).

**Most of your participation in this course will not be spent inside the “course” itself** (e.g., reading things on this site, course.sjmd.space). The course is fundamentally a series of links to other materials, experiences, and resources that exist outsideof this site. 

And those are what we're calling the Topics.
