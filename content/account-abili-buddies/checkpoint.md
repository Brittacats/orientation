Another account-abili-buddy you can rely on throughout the course is the checkpoints.

These are opportunities for you to hold yourself accountable, by making sure you've completed the key steps in the Topic or Module you just experienced.

I have...

- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-1"> <label for="checkbox-1">Completed the Welcome Questionnaire ([here's the link](https://forms.gle/A2tDBHjAYb8R3ciC9)), or actively chosen not to complete it.</label>
- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-2"> <label for="checkbox-2">Checked my email to make sure emails from team@sjmd.space aren't going to my spam.</label>
