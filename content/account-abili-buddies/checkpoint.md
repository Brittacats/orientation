Another account-abili-buddy you can rely on throughout the course is the checkpoints.

These are opportunities for you to hold yourself accountable, by making sure you've completed the key steps in the Topic or Module you just experienced.

Here's what a checkpoint will look like in the course:

{{% icon checkered-flag %}}

- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-1"> <label for="checkbox-1">This is the first item [with link](test.html)</label>
- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-2"> <label for="checkbox-2">This is the second and longer item in the list</label>
