We also want you to hold us accountable, and contribute to improving the Course. We'll provide specific outlets for this regularly (asking for input at the end of each Module). There are also a few always-available ways to feed back.

See the little "Suggest Edits" and "Get Help" links at the bottom of this page? They're on most of the course steps.

**Suggest edits** will take you directly to where this course app file lives on GitHub, and you can recommend a change (e.g., if we're doing something wrong, there's a typo, or a better way to phrase something).  

**Get help** will take you to a [help page](https://course.sjmd.space/help) with other links and pathways to find support, or call attention to issues.

And you can always reply to any emails we send you, or email us directly (team@sjmd.space will go to everyone who is helping make this thing happen).
