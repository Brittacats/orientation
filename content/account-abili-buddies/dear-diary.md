We'll be encouraging you to talk to others in your life, and also to talk to yourself. But in a structured way!

**When we mention journaling, actually write/type out your thoughts, reactions, and perspectives** -- don't just think about your answers -- it makes a difference. 

A physical notebook, Google Drive document, Word doc, or Text Edit file, or email chain to yourself all count.

If you've never written in a journal or diary, this will be a fun new experiment! If you're a veteran, we suggest you set aside a particular notebook (physical or digital) for your SJMD jotting.
