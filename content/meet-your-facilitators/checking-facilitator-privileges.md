Around the SJMD Community, you'll undoubtedly meet lots of new people. And they'll be helpful, encouraging, answer questions, and ask good questions.

Only some of them will be facilitators -- formally, at least.

To spot a facilitator, look for the little magic wand icon below their profile picture.

Alternatively, you can find all the facilitators at [community.sjmd.space/about](https://community.sjmd.space/about), listed under the **Our Admins** subheading.
